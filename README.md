# LupaDevStudio 🐺

## About us 🗒️

Established on July 5, 2023, LupaDevStudio is an independent French studio specializing in developing applications and video games for mobile and computer platforms. We are a team of three students passionate about programming, and we founded LupaDevStudio to share our creations with you. 

## Our goal 🚀

We want to create small games and apps on our own and to share them while keeping the code open-source.

To create our apps, we use the Python library [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) which allows us to package our code for all plateforms.

So far we published three apps:

- [Postrias :t-rex:](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lupadevstudio.com.postrias) : a strategy game in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by dinosaurs
- [Tramway Collector 🚊](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tramwaycollector) : an app to help you to manage a collection of tramway photos
- [Lumacryte 👻](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lumacryte) : an exploration game developed during the [Open Source Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/open-source-ai-game-jam)
