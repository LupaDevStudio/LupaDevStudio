# LupaDevStudio 🐺

## About us 🗒️

LupaDevStudio is a small team of Python developers interested in mobile development especially Android for now.

## Our goal 🚀

We want to create small games and apps on our own and to share them while keeping the code open-source.

To create our apps, we use the Python library [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) which allows us to package our code for all plateforms.

## Our work 📱

If you want to discover our work, check our repositories or our [PlayStore page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7601849429544070782&hl=fr&gl=US).

So far we published two apps:

- Tramway Collector 🚊 : an app to help you to manage a collection of tramway photos
- Lumacryte 👻 : a game developed during the [Open Source Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/open-source-ai-game-jam)
