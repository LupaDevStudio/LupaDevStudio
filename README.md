# LupaDevStudio 🐺

## About us 🗒️

Established on July 5, 2023, LupaDevStudio is an independent French studio specializing in developing applications and video games for mobile and computer platforms. We are a team of three students passionate about programming, and we founded LupaDevStudio to share our creations with you. 

## Our goal 🚀

We want to create games and apps on our own and to share them while keeping the code open-source.

To create our apps, we use the Python library [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) which allows us to package our code for all plateforms.
